## ---- A Book-Entry System Linking To Web 3.0 Capital Market 

**ComBoox** is a blockchain-based book-entry system designed for equity share registration and statutory books keeping, which is aimed to assist users to quickly establish a legal, secure, transparent, and reliable smart contracts system on blockchain for registering equity share and keeping records of corporate governance, so as to enable rights holders such as investors, shareholders, managers, and business partners be able to directly engage in almost all the share transactions and corporate governance activities under the automatic control of smart contracts, including share subscription, transfer, pledge, consideration payment, contracts signing, motion submission, voting, nomination, appointment, resignation etc.

By leveraging the technical features of blockchain and smart contracts, ComBoox may fundamentally solve the corporate governance problems such as **"Insider Control"** and **"Misleading Statements"** that has plagued the capital market for many years, and completely realize:

1. right holder may **directly exercise** rights; 
2. obligor has **no chance** to default; and
3. **real-time** information disclosing.

By booking the equity shares on blockchain, investors may use cryptocurrency or Central Bank Digital Currencies to pay for share consideration, which means effectively connecting the companies’ equity shares to the trillion-dollar cryptocurrency market, so that the companies may have an opportunity to have their value being reevaluated and reconfirmed with the support of the huge liquidity.
